    "#### Dataset Name: Real World Traffic Volume Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Contextual Description: \n",
    "- This dataset provides real-world hourly traffic data collected from the I-94 interstate highway between Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. It focuses on westbound traffic volume and includes environmental and temporal factors that influence it, such as weather conditions, temperature, precipitation, and holidays. The data spans several years and is suitable for regression tasks to predict traffic congestion or flow based on these real-world conditions. The target variable is 'traffic_volume' (a continuous numerical value representing vehicles per hour), and it has at least three explanatory variables like 'temp' (temperature in Kelvin), 'rain_1h' (rainfall in mm), and 'snow_1h' (snowfall in mm), making it ideal for simple and multiple linear regression analysis."

    "## Part 2: Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical Problem Definition\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to predict hourly traffic volume on a highway using environmental and weather-related factors. Understanding how variables such as temperature, rainfall, snowfall, and cloud cover influence traffic flow can support better traffic management, congestion prediction, and infrastructure planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependent Variable\n",
    "- **Traffic_Vol**: A continuous numerical variable representing the number of vehicles recorded per hour on the highway.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictor (Independent) Variables\n",
    "The explanatory variables selected for the regression analysis include:\n",
    "- **Temperature**: Average ambient temperature measured in Kelvin  \n",
    "- **Rainfall_last_hour**: Amount of rainfall (in millimeters) recorded in the previous hour  \n",
    "- **Snowfall_last_hour**: Amount of snowfall (in millimeters) recorded in the previous hour  \n",
    "- **Cloud_Cover**: Percentage of cloud cover during the hour  \n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables such as **Weather** and **Weather_Desc** are excluded from the linear regression model due to their non-numeric nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification for Using Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear Regression is an appropriate modeling approach for this problem because:\n",
    "- The dependent variable, **Traffic_Vol**, is continuous and numerical.\n",
    "- The selected predictor variables are quantitative and are expected to have approximately linear relationships with traffic volume.\n",
    "- The dataset supports both **Simple Linear Regression** (e.g., modeling Traffic_Vol as a function of Temperature) and **Multiple Linear Regression** (using multiple weather-related predictors).\n",
    "- Linear Regression provides interpretable results, allowing clear assessment of how individual weather factors influence traffic volume.\n"
