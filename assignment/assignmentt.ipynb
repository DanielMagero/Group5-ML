    "##### Contextual Description: \n",
    "- This dataset provides real-world hourly traffic data collected from the I-94 interstate highway between Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. It focuses on westbound traffic volume and includes environmental and temporal factors that influence it, such as weather conditions, temperature, precipitation, and holidays. The data spans several years and is suitable for regression tasks to predict traffic congestion or flow based on these real-world conditions. The target variable is 'traffic_volume' (a continuous numerical value representing vehicles per hour), and it has at least three explanatory variables like 'temp' (temperature in Kelvin), 'rain_1h' (rainfall in mm), and 'snow_1h' (snowfall in mm), making it ideal for simple and multiple linear regression analysis."
